24 Treats of Christmas: Last-minute recipes for when you’re short on time and ingredients

In the final instalment of our holiday baking bonanza, we’re keeping it quick and easy – but delicious – with a few holiday staples

We’ve reached the last batch of The Globe and Mail’s 24 Treats of Christmas. We hope you’ve enjoyed following along – some of you via text message – with our recipes for cookies and squares, chocolate desserts and holiday favourites. The following recipes are for last-minute holiday sweets and treats that will satisfy cravings in little time.

Each recipe includes adaptations to suit your tastes and the ingredients you have on hand. This week we’re using holiday staples to whip up no-bake versions of lemon meringue and cheesecake, along with buttery shortbread, a winter sangria and, for leisurely mornings, eggnog scones and panettone bread pudding.

Makes 8 servings

Level of effort: Easy

Recipe notes: Sangria made with winter spices is brighter than warm mulled wine, and a way to use up the dregs of the bottles. Feel free to combine red, white and rosé, and even sparkling that has gone flat.

    1/3 cup brown sugar
    3-4 slices fresh ginger
    2 cinnamon sticks
    2 star anise or cardamom pods
    A sprig or two of fresh rosemary
    2 cups orange juice
    1 bottle red wine
    ½ cup brandy (optional)
    A few slices of orange and/or apple

In a small saucepan, combine brown sugar with 1 cup water and the ginger, cinnamon sticks, star anise and rosemary. Bring to a simmer and cook for a few minutes; remove from the heat and set aside to cool.

Pour the spiced syrup through a sieve into a large pitcher and add the orange juice, red wine and brandy. Add some orange and/or apple slices, and an extra sprig of rosemary if you like. Chill until you’re ready to pour.
